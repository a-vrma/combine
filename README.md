`ccombine` is based on a script in the Zstd source called [`combine.sh`][csh].
I rewrote it in Python because the original is very slow (see
[the benchmark][bnh]). The only change is a better command-line interface.

It can be used to create an amalgamated distribution of your library for easy
embedding into another source tree. Some reasons to do this are outlined in
[nothings/stb][sfl] and ["SQLite is really easy to compile"][je].

You can install it by cloning and running `pip install .`. This will install a
script called `ccombine` into your Python environment. Alternatively, you can
simply download [`ccombine.py`][ccom]. The only requirement is Python 3.7 and
its standard library.

If you need 3.6 compatibility see the python36-compat branch. Note that it is
often rebased and force-pushed.
